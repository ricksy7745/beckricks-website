      <p class="project-text">
        This project was part of a tournament organized by my artificial intelligence professor. 
        We were invited to create an AI that would play Reversi, a basic strategy game like checkers
        that involves randomn elements (the opponents moves) that an AI cannot certainly predict.
        I designed my AI agent mainly using Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate the best decisions while
        compensating for its opponents uncertain decision. I  wanted to implement a machine learning 
        element to its decision making that could 'predict' the opponent's best move (something like 
        Google's AlphaGo) but ran out of time to implement this.
        I managed to qualify for the top cut of the tournament with this implementation.

      <h2 class="project-header">Heart Disease Machine Analysis</h2>
      <p class="project-text">
        This was a project I did for one of my university courses on machine learning. 
        For this project, we were tasked with using the variety of machine learning 
        techniques we learned to analyze a robust, messy dataset. Our group decided to analyze 
        a dataset revolving around patients with and without heart disease. You can find the
        whole write-up <a href="./files/heart-disease-write-up.docx" download> here.</a>

      <h2 class="project-header">Bayes Filter Agent</h2>
      <p class="project-text">
        Another project I did during my artificial intelligence course, this project revolves 
        around an agent that is trying to get to the end of a maze. Though the agent has an
        accurate layout of the enviornment, its sensors are not completely accurate in reading
        its surrounding. It also has a chance of 'misstepping' when it makes moves. To compensate
        for this, the agent uses a Bayesian filter I implemented to predict where it is based on
        its readings. The deeper the blue, the more likely the agent thinks it is in that location.
        The green circle represents its best guess as to where it is.

      <h2 class="project-header">Prowess Backend</h2>
      <p class="project-text">
        This project is part of an internship I did with Prowess, a start-up 
        I connected with through one of my classes. During my time with Prowess, 
        I was able to work on new back-end interactions with their products, namely
        designing a queueing / scoring system to investigate the effectiveness 
        of matchmaking algorithms we were designing. Below you can find a demonstation
        of the front end queueing system and associated leaderboard that use these back-end
        interactions. I also did investigative design work on the algorithms associated with 
        this system, though I am not at liberty to discuss their specifics.
